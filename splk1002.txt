All you need is to remember this: FACLET

Kundan23 Most Recent 3 months, 4 weeks ago
Selected Answer: B
The correct answer is B. A field added by an automatic lookup.

A calculated field is a field that is added to events at search time by using an eval expression. A calculated field can use the values of two or more fields that are already present in the events to perform calculations.A calculated field can use any field as a source, as long as the field is extracted before the calculated field is defined1.

An automatic lookup is a way to enrich events with additional fields from an external source, such as a CSV file or a database.An automatic lookup can add fields to eventsbased on the values ofexisting fields, such as host, source, sourcetype, or any other extracted field2.An automatic lookup is performed before the calculated fields are defined, so the fields added by the lookup can be used as sources for the calculated fields3.

Therefore, a calculated field can use a field added by an automatic lookup as a source.

A calculated field can use any field in the data source as a source, including fields that are added by an automatic lookup. This is because the automatic lookup is performed before the calculated field is evaluated.

The other options are incorrect because:

An alias of a field is not a separate field, so it cannot be used as a source.
The tag field and the eventtype field are both system fields, which cannot be used as sources.

Why not B also? A field added by an automatic lookup can be used as a source for a calculated field. When a lookup is configured to automatically add fields to events based on a lookup table, the added fields can be used in calculations just like any other field.

For example, suppose you have a lookup table that maps user IDs to department names. When you perform a search and the lookup table is applied, a new field called "department" is automatically added to each event, based on the user ID in the event. You can then use this "department" field as a source for a calculated field, such as counting the number of events by department. Therefore, B is the correct answer.

A correct Preventing overrides of existing fields
If a calculated field has the same name as a field that has been extracted by normal means, the calculated field will override the extracted field, even if the eval statement evaluates to null. You can cancel this override with the coalesce function for eval in conjunction with the eval expression. Coalesce takes an arbitrary number of arguments and returns the first value that is not null.

This is a hard understandable and trick question. In my first read I thought it was ABC but after a while and doing some researches I end up with A and B. Here is my explanation: 

C - CIM is not a tool to create Knowledge OBjects. Knowledge manager use CIM to have a default start up of Knowledge OBjects.

D - Despite Add-on be a TYPE of APP, add-on is not equal to an app. 
"Unlike an Add-on, App caters towards only a single perspective. It is used only for one common goal and it can be used for a specific thing."

What is the Common Information Model (CIM)?
 The Splunk Common Information Model provides a methodology to
normalize data
 Leverage the CIM when creating field extractions, field aliases,
event types, and tags to ensure:
 Multiple apps can co-exist on a single Splunk deployment
 Object permissions can be set to global for the use of multiple
apps
 Easier and more efficient correlation of data from different
sources and source types

Sam1289 1 year ago
Selected Answer: C
C. The macro's argument count setting is 3 or more.

For a macro to accept three arguments, the macro's argument count setting needs to be configured to allow three or more arguments. The argument count setting determines the number of arguments that a macro can accept. By setting it to 3 or more, the macro becomes capable of receiving three specific arguments.

Option A, stating that the macro's name ends with (3), is not a requirement for a macro to accept three arguments. The name of the macro does not determine the number of arguments it can accept.

Option B, suggesting that the macro's name starts with (3), is also not a requirement. Again, the name of the macro does not dictate the number of arguments it can receive.

Option D, claiming that nothing is required and all macros can accept any number of arguments, is incorrect. Macros in Splunk require explicit configuration of the argument count setting to define the number of arguments they can accept.

A. Arguments are defined at execution time.
C. Argument values are used to resolve the search string at execution time.

The following statements about macros are true:

A. Arguments are defined at execution time: Macros allow you to define placeholders for arguments that can be filled in with specific values when the macro is executed. The values of these arguments are provided at runtime or execution time, allowing for flexibility and dynamic customization of the macro's behavior.

C. Argument values are used to resolve the search string at execution time: Macros often include a search string as part of their definition. When the macro is executed and the argument values are provided, these values are used to resolve the search string, replacing the argument placeholders with the specified values. This allows the macro to generate a search string tailored to the specific use case or provided values.

ABC is the correct answer. Tested: Settings -> Fields  Workflow actions  Add new
mandatory fields (*): 
- Name (Enter a unique name without spaces or special characters. This is used for identifying your workflow action later on within Splunk Settings.), 
- Label (Enter the label that appears for this action. Optionally, incorporate a field's value by enclosing the field name in dollar signs, e.g. 'Search for ticket number : $ticketnum$'.),
- Action Type (link, search), 
- URI (Enter the location to link to. Optionally, specify fields by enclosing the field name in dollar signs, e.g. http://www.google.com/search?q=$host$.).

C is wrong becasue If you use the sort command first and then the eval command, you need to ensure that the sort command is sorting the values in the desired way (i.e., as strings rather than numerically), and you need to use the str function within the sort command to force it to treat the values as strings. This can make the command more complicated and increase the likelihood of errors.

Well, even though in the PDF says that "Can apply field aliases to lookups" in page 181, in here [1] says "Splunk software applies field aliases to a search after it performs key-value field extraction, but before it processes calculated fields, lookups, event types, and tags.

This means that you can create aliases for fields that are extracted at index time or search time, but you cannot create aliases for calculated fields, event types, tags, or fields that are added to your events by a lookup."

Yes your statement is absolutely correct. But take a moment to think on it. That says that you can create Lookups based on Aliases because Aliases are created first at searchtime.

A. Tabs: Tabs can be used as delimiters for field extraction in Splunk. They are commonly used when data is separated by tab characters.

B. Pipes: Pipes (|) can be used as delimiters in Splunk's Field Extractor. This is especially useful when data is structured using pipe characters as separators.

C. Colons: Colons (:) can also be used as delimiters when defining field extractions in Splunk. If your data is separated by colons, you can specify this delimiter.

D. Spaces: Spaces can be used as delimiters as well. If your data is separated by spaces, you can configure the Field Extractor to recognize spaces as delimiters.

So, all of the options (A, B, C, D) can work as delimiters when using the Field Extractor in Splunk, depending on how your data is structured and separated. You can choose the appropriate delimiter that matches the format of your data.

B&D: "field aliases, field extractions, and lookups."
upvoted 1 times
HereToLearny 1 year, 1 month ago
Selected Answer: D
The Answer is D. It can not be B because - 
Sure. Lookups are used to map values from one field to another. They cannot be used to normalize data by extracting the same data from different events and storing it in the same field.

For example, a lookup could be used to map the value "John Doe" from the user_name field to the full_name field. This would not normalize the data, as the user_name and full_name fields would still contain different data.

Lookups can be used to normalize data in some cases, but they are not the only knowledge object that can be used for this purpose. Field extractions are a more powerful tool for normalizing data, as they can be used to extract data from events and store it in fields.

If a user wants to convert numeric field values to strings and then sort on those values, they should use the eval command first and then the sort command.

The eval command is used to add a new field to the search results that contains the string representation of the numeric field. For example, the following eval command converts the count field to a string: | eval count_str=tostring(count)

Answer is C:
maxspan Syntax: maxspan=<int>[s | m | h | d]
Description: Specifies the maximum length of time in seconds, minutes, hours, or days that the events can span. The events in the transaction must span less than integer specified for maxspan. Events that exceed the maxspan limit are treated as part of a separate transaction. If the value is negative, the maxspan constraint is disabled and there is no limit.
Default: -1 (no limit)

Creation of data models for Pivot users. Splunk software offers the Pivot tool for users who want to quickly create tables, charts, and dashboards without having to write search strings that can sometimes be long and complicated. The Pivot tool is driven by data models--without a data model Pivot has nothing to report on. Data models are designed by Splunk knowledge managers: people who understand the format and semantics of their indexed data, and who are familiar with the Splunk search language.

Meanwhile, a data model derived from a heterogeneous system log might have several root datasets (events, searches, and transactions). Each of these root datasets can be the first dataset in a hierarchy of datasets with nested parent and child relationships. Each child dataset in a dataset hierarchy can have new fields in addition to the fields they inherit from ancestor datasets.

In Splunk, calculated fields can use extracted fields in their calculations, but it is not a requirement. Calculated fields can perform calculations with the values of two or more fields already present in those events. These fields can be extracted fields or any other field present in the event data. So, to answer your question, calculated fields can use extracted fields in their calculations, but it is not a must.

D is the answer....

Fun2(Page 135) transaction vs. stats
 When you have a choice, use statsits faster and more efficient,
especially in large Splunk environments
 Only use transaction when you:

Need to see events correlated together
 Must define event grouping based on start/end values or segment on time
 Use stats when you:

Want to see the results of a calculation
 Can group events based on a field value (e.g., by src_ip)
 By default, theres a limit of 1,000 events per transaction
No such limit applies to stats
 Admins can change limit by configuring max_events_per_bucket in
limits.conf
upvoted 4 times
Shafiqul 3 years, 2 months ago
Answer seems D. But note: I have seen somewhere else in a different dump, A mentioned group on multiple events. In that case answer would have been A since D didn't says startswith or endswith constraints (granular)

B&D - the context for the search is correct. This is an example directly from Splunk: 
"transaction host cookie maxspan=30s maxpause=5s"
upvoted 2 times
Harrysa 1 year, 3 months ago
The correct answer is D. The maxspan option specifies that the first and last events in a transaction can be no more than 30 seconds apart. The maxpause option specifies that if there is a pause between events longer than 5 seconds, a new transaction will be started. Therefore, option D is correct as it describes the maximum time duration allowed for a transaction to occur between its first and last events. Options A and C are incorrect because they refer to a different parameter not mentioned in the Splunk search command. Option B is partially correct, as it describes the fields used to group events together, but it does not describe the time constraints on the transaction itself.

answer is BD - Define a transaction based on Web access events that share the same IP address. The first and last events in the transaction should be no more than thirty seconds apart and each event should not be longer than five seconds apart.

Selected Answer: BD
Example is here: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.1/SearchReference/Transaction

Define a transaction based on Web access events that have a unique combination of host and clientip values. The first and last events in the transaction should be no more than thirty seconds apart and each event should not be longer than five seconds apart.

So it would group events in a transaction where IP=1.2.3.4 and hostwww1. IP=1.2.3.4 and host=www2 would be in another transacton (B)

A is a trick question or badly formulated. Pause between events within the transactions should be no more than 5s apart. However, the total transaction time can be much longer.

B,D are correct. 

Here is the description of the maxpause command
Specifies the maximum length of time in seconds, minutes, hours, or days for the pause between the events in a transaction. If value is negative, the maxpause constraint is disabled and there is no limit.

A would only be definitively correct if the transaction had 2 events. If it has more than 2 events then the time between the first and last event are unknown, all we know is no 2 events are more than 5 seconds apart.

Selected Answer: D
The correct answer is D. Use stats when the events need to be viewed as a single correlated event.

The transaction command is used to group events together based on common field values. It can also use more complex constraints such as the total period of the transaction, delays between events within the transaction, and required beginning and ending events. The stats command is used to calculate statistics on events grouped by one or more fields. It does not retain the raw event and other field values from the original event.

The transaction command is slower than the stats command, but it is more flexible. It can be used to group events together based on more complex criteria. The stats command is faster, but it is less flexible. It can only group events together based on field values.

The transaction command is limited to 1000 events. The stats command has no limit on the number of events that it can group together.

If you need to view the events as a single correlated event, you should use the transaction command. If you need to calculate statistics on the events, you should use the stats command.

The stats command in Splunk can include both an over and a by clause to divide results into sub-groupings. This allows for more granular analysis and breakdown of data based on multiple fields or criteria. The by clause specifies the primary grouping, while the over clause specifies secondary groupings within each primary group.

Example:

Search for tagged field values
You have two ways to search for tags. To search for a tag associated with a value in any field, use the following syntax:

tag=<tagname>
To search for a tag associated with a value in a specific field, use the following syntax:

tag::<field>=<tagname>

Timechart requires the argument `span`, not `timespan`. As well, you must specify the unit of time (example 3h or 5m) with this argument so the only option is `span=12h`.

I would say probably A, the current search is probably meant to be:
 | eval field1 = if(isnotnull(fieid1),field1,0), field2 = if(isnull,field2, "NO VALUE")
Thus, the first part which is asking if field1 isnotnull eg 104, then make that value 0. Points me to A, as no fillnull command or option here can do this step.
